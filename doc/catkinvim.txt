=================================================
Section 1: Usage		    *CatkinUsage*

This plugin adds a small wrapper for the catkin
build system into vim.

In order to use the plugin to build catkin packages,
simply run :make from any buffer which contains a file
inside a catkin workspace.

If you want to setup the workspace such that YouCompleteMe
will work correctly, use the |:CaConfig| command.

If you use wstool, you can use the |:CaWstool| command to update
the wstool packages.

=====================================================
Section 2: Autocommands 	   *CatkinAutocommands*

This plugin adds one autocommand on buffer read to
set the makeprg to catkin inside a catkin buffer.

======================================================
Section 3: Commands                *CatkinCommands*
